# Customer Data Insights Repository

This repository serves as a central location for insights derived from our customer dataset. It primarily focuses on identifying valuable customer segments and providing actionable information to inform marketing strategies, product development, and customer relationship management. As we continue our analysis, more insight types will be added.

## Customer Segmentation

This section contains detailed descriptions and BigQuery queries for various customer segments identified within the dataset.

### High-Value, High-Frequency Young Adults

This segment identifies young adult customers (20-39 years old) who demonstrate both high purchasing frequency and high customer lifetime value. More details, including the specific criteria and BigQuery SQL query, can be found in the [Customer Segment Description](customer_segment_description.md) file.
